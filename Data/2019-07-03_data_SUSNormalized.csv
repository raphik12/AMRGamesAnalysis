5,7/3/2019 11:25:52,0,Dr Bug: Microbe Mayhem,2,4,2,0,3,2,2,2,3,1,2,none
6,7/3/2019 11:26:54,22,Superbugs: the Game,2,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,2,1,2,the game is a little repetitive but we quickly understand the effect of AMR
7,7/3/2019 11:27:03,9,Dr Bug: Microbe Mayhem,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,Wasnt very fun but i was pretty interactive and easy to use

10,7/3/2019 11:27:58,24,Superbugs: the Game,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,3,it's a good game but i won't play it at home because the gameplay is always the same and strategy is meaningless

13,7/3/2019 11:31:18,10,Dr Bug: Microbe Mayhem,3,3,2,0,2,1,3,3,2,0,1,The tutorial could emphasize on where do one see the health of other 2 kids ; I realized it later in 2nd game
14,7/3/2019 11:33:45,11,Dr Bug: Microbe Mayhem,2,1,1,0,0,2,3,3,2,2,0,The game UX is a bit difficult to denote the different parameters.

27,7/3/2019 11:53:15,10,Superbugs: the Game,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,It was easy to understand . No switching of screens as in the Dr Bug Mayhem game made it less complex 
28,7/3/2019 11:53:34,15,Superbugs: the Game,4,2,2,0,4,2,0,0,2,4,0,"I like this game. The colors match,the sound to. But i think that there no enought time to kill the bad bacteries."

34,7/3/2019 12:12:44,21,Fungal Invaders,3,2,2,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,4,The interphase and actions are touch the actions what we try to implement are not done exactly. the touch relay is different and difficult in the game.
35,7/3/2019 12:12:55,18,Fungal Invaders,4,3,3,1,4,3,2,4,2,0,4,"Well... I had an idea or two about this subject and I felt that it wasnt integrated well because when I clicked on the antidote, it was constantly also moving my injection. There are some glitches... and I felt that the game was a little boring. It was also too slow. "

40,7/3/2019 12:15:10,8,Fungal Invaders,4,0,0,0,4,1,0,1,1,0,4,positions of the tools to shoot and kill were placed poorly
41,7/3/2019 12:15:13,15,Fungal Invaders,3,1,3,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,There is no enought time to kill the big one. It comes so fastly.
